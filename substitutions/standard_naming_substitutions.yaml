    # naming of entities and devices is not going well in
    # HA based on these. System name should be used for the
    # entitiy in ha (sensor.system_name) but the friendly name
    # is always prepended. This yields sensor.friendly_name_system_name
    # So you could go for an empty friendly_name, but the proble is,
    # is that the friendlyname is used in the templates by HA. So,
    # an empty friendly_name is not advisable. What happens if I use empty
    # system_name? no does not work, device_name can't be empty
